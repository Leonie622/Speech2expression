For all of the semantic directions, we have:

pose:		postive for #left#, negtive for #right#

gender:		postive for #male#, negtive for #female# 

age:		postive for #young#, negtive for #old# 

expression:	postive for #smile#, negtive for #calm# 

eyeglasses:	postive for #eyeglass#, negtive for #no-eyeglass# 


E.g., suppose that w is a latent code and d is the semantic direction for age. 
To change w's age attribute towards old, we need to compute the edited latent code as w-kd.
